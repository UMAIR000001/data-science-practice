# GenAI Week 3 – GitHub & Kaggle Progress

Assalam o Alaikum 👋  
Welcome to my **GenAI Week 3** assignment repo! This repository contains all my work from Week 1,2 of  Summer Break, including:

- My learnings from the Google GenAI course on Kaggle
- Creative prompts I used with AI tools
- A basic Python script
- My Kaggle competition project progress

## 📘 What's Inside?

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `summary.txt` | My personal learning summary from the 5-Day LLM course by Google and my Kaggle project review |
| `prompt_examples.md` | 3 smart prompts I explored to push my GenAI and data science thinking |
| `hello.py` *(optional)* | A simple Python file to test Git/GitHub workflow |

## 🎯 Goal of This Repo

This repository is a hands-on exercise to practice:

- ✅ Git & GitHub basics (version control, commits, pushing changes)
- ✅ Writing and structuring markdown files
- ✅ Experimenting with LLM prompts
- ✅ Tracking progress in a real Kaggle competition

## 🌟 What I Learned

- How to manage code and text files using Git and GitHub  
- How GenAI can help in real-world data science tasks  
- The importance of prompt design in getting useful responses from AI  
- How to review and learn from Kaggle competition notebooks
