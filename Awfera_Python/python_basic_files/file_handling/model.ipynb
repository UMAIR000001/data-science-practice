    "üìÅ File Handling in Python\n",
    "In Python, file handling allows you to create, read, write, and close files. Two main functions used for this are open() and close().\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 1. open() Function\n",
    "The open() function is used to open a file so that you can read from, write to, or create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "open(file_name , mode)\n",
    "file_name: The name or path of the file you want to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "mode: Specifies the action to perform on the file (read, write, etc.) and the format (text or binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "üî∏ Common File Modes\n",
    "Mode\tDescription\n",
    "'r'\tRead (text mode). File must exist.\n",
    "'r+'\tRead and write (text mode). File must exist.\n",
    "'w'\tWrite (text mode). Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.\n",
    "'a'\tAppend (text mode). Adds content at the end of the file.\n",
    "'rb'\tRead (binary mode).\n",
    "'wb'\tWrite (binary mode).\n",
    "'ab'\tAppend (binary mode).\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The mode argument is optional. If omitted, Python defaults to 'r' (read mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Example:\n",
    "file = open(\"demo.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 2. close() Function\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file, releasing the resources associated with it.\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "It does not return anything.\n",
    "Always close a file after completing file operations to avoid memory leaks or file corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Recommended Way: with open() Block\n",
    "Using with open() is the preferred and safer method because it automatically closes the file after you're done ‚Äî even if an error occurs.\n",
    "with open(\"demo.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "This is cleaner, prevents bugs, and is considered best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìÅ Python file handling is NOT limited to .txt files.\n",
    "Python can handle many types of files, depending on how you open them (i.e., mode and format).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "1. Text Files (.txt, .csv, .html, .log, .json, etc.)\n",
    "Use text mode (default: 'r', 'w', 'a', etc.)\n"
